 LOGIC


### Description
        A tiny library that lets you perform logic operations and gives you the power to simulate
	(basic/special/universal) logic gate ICs.

### DISCLAIMER:
	This project is at an alpha stage with no proper docs.
    If you are the type of guy who live on the edge, Read the
    source and experiment. You can go with the docs too but first-"read the
    source luke".

### To-do:
1. When shorting output pins, sending the pin number of the source is redundant.
Find a workaround.
    
2. Write proper documentation.

3. Write test cases for all scenarios.

4. Decide what to do with char *gate_names[] in header file. Move it to implementation file?

5. update README.
